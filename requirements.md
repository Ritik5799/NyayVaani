# Project Requirements

## 1. Problem Statement
A large section of the population faces difficulty in raising civic and institutional
grievances due to low literacy, language barriers, and lack of awareness about proper
complaint channels. As a result, many issues remain unreported or unresolved.

## 2. Target Users
- Primary: Citizens from underserved and low-literacy communities
- Secondary: Local authorities, NGOs, community volunteers

## 3. Proposed Solution
A voice-first, AI-powered grievance system that allows users to speak their issue
in their native language and automatically converts it into a formal, routed complaint
with status tracking.

## 4. Functional Requirements
- FR1: Users can submit grievances using voice input
- FR2: System supports multiple local languages
- FR3: AI classifies grievances into predefined categories
- FR4: System generates structured complaints automatically
- FR5: Users receive voice-based status updates

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- Accessibility: Works for low-literacy users
- Scalability: Supports multiple concurrent users
- Performance: Response time under 5 seconds
- Privacy: No long-term storage of voice data

## 6. Constraints & Assumptions
- Internet connectivity may be limited
- Open-source and API-based tools preferred
- MVP focuses on common grievance categories

## 7. Success Metrics
- Number of grievances successfully submitted
- Reduction in complaint filing time
- User satisfaction and feedback
